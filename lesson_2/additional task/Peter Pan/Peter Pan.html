<h1>Peter Pan</h1>

<i>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
This article is about the character Peter Pan. For the original play and novel about the character,

<p><b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scottish_novelists">Scottish novelist</a> and
playwright <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie">J. M. Barrie.</a>
A free-spirited and mischievous young boy who can fly and never grows up, Peter Pan spends his never-ending childhood
having adventures on the mythical island of Neverland as the leader of the Lost Boys, interacting with fairies, pirates,
mermaids, Native Americans, and occasionally ordinary children from the world outside Neverland.</p>

<p>Peter Pan has become a cultural icon symbolizing youthful innocence and escapism. In addition to two distinct works by Barrie,
The Little White Bird (1902, with chapters 13–18 published in Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens in 1906), 
and the West End stage play Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up (1904, which expanded into the 1911 novel Peter and Wendy),
the character has been featured in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding on Barrie's works. 
  These include several films, television series and many other works.</p>

<p>Barrie commissioned a statue of Peter Pan by the sculptor George Frampton, which was erected overnight in Kensington
Gardens on 30 April 1912
as a surprise to the children of London.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-1"><sup>[1]</sup> </a>
Six other statues have been cast from the original mould
and displayed around the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail
  on the centenary of Barrie's creation of
  the character.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-2"><sup> [2]</sup></a></p>

<h3>Origin</h3>
<hr>
<p>Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's The Little White Bird (1902), a novel for adults. In chapters 13–18,
titled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to Kensington Gardens in London,
where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird.
Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of his stage play titled Peter Pan,
or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the Duke of
York's Theatre in London.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, Hodder and Stoughton,
extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens,
with the addition of illustrations by
Arthur Rackham.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
Barrie later adapted and expanded the 1904 play's storyline as a novel,
  which was published in 1911 as Peter and Wendy.</p>

<p>J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident
the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought
  of him as forever a boy.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<h3>Physical appearance</h3>
<hr>
<p>1907 illustration of Peter Pan by Oliver Herford
Barrie never described Peter's appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of the reader and
the interpretation of anyone adapting the character. In the play, Peter's outfit is made of autumn leaves
and cobwebs.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
His name and playing the flute or pipes suggest the Greek god and mythological character Pan. 
Barrie mentions in Peter and Wendy that Peter Pan still had all his
"first teeth".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-chap1-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> He describes him as a "lovely boy,
clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of
  trees".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-chap1-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p>Traditionally, the character has been played on stage by a petite
adult woman.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-8"><sup>[8]</sup> </a>In the original productions in the UK,
Peter Pan's costume was a reddish tunic and dark green tight, such as that worn by Nina Boucicault in 1904. This costume
is exhibited at Barrie's Birthplace.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-9" ><sup>[9]</sup> </a>The similar costume worn by Pauline Chase (who played the role from 1906 to 1913)
is displayed in the Museum of London. Early editions of adaptations of the story also depict
a red costume<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-10" ><sup>[10]</sup></a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
but a green costume (wheather or not made of leaves) becomes more usual from the
1920s,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> and more so later after
the release of Disney's animated movie.</p>

<p>In the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tight apparently made of cloth,
  and a cap with a red feather in it. He has pointed elf-like ears, brown eyes, and reddish hair.</p>

<p>In Hook (1991), the character is played as an adult by Robin Williams, with blue eyes and dark brown hair; in flashbacks
to him in his youth, his hair is light brown. His ears appear pointed only when he is Peter Pan, not as Peter Banning. 
  His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus the cap).</p>

<p>In the live-action 2003 Peter Pan film, he is portrayed by Jeremy Sumpter, with blond hair, green eyes, bare feet and
a costume made of leaves and vines.</p>

<p>In the prequel to the main story 2015 Pan film, he is portrayed by Levi Miller, a young boy who was left as a baby by
  the orphanage until he gets captured by Blackbeard's pirates and taken to Neverland. Here he wears just simple clothes.</p>
